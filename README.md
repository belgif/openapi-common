# openapi-common

This repository contains OpenAPI data types for common technical data like Uuid, HttpLink and LongRunningTaskStatus.
Their use is documented in the [REST guide](https://www.gcloud.belgium.be/rest/).

Within a major version, types remain backwards compatible once they are released.
Types in a beta version or not included in releases and may change in a backwards incompatible way.
